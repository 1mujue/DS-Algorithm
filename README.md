# DS-Algorithm

This repo is for learning data structure and algorithm. In `alg` folder, there are PLENTY of classical problems that will help you to learn algorithm, and in `DS` folder, there are a lof of VERY IMPORTANT data structures. Each classical problem in `alg` folder would have a problem link(if not, I probably forget it, and I will refine it latter), and ALL problems are either from `https://leetcode.cn/` or [luogu.com'](https://www.luogu.com.cn/).

## Note
The part of data structure is still being refined. Also, there are some interseactions between algorithm and data structure (since I am a C lover).
